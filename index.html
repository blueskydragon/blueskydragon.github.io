                    I started watching anime as a little kid and have always liked it. I've always like the story and the animations.
                    I stopped watching it for a while but since 7th grade I started to go back into it. I still like watching it but once in a while I start reading the manga.
                    One of my favorite anime is Kuroko no Basuke.
